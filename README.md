# The-dream-machine-localization
Russian localization for "The Dream Machine" game (only chapter 1 so far)

<a name="old-version"></a>
## How to install old version of the game (Steam)?
> **Steam library** - (Games list) - **The Dream Machine** - (RMB) - **Properties** - **Beta versions** - (previous)

After installing the old version, try to run the game.

If you get an error saying the game's executable file ```_the_dream_machine.exe``` is not found, don't worry.

Just copy the existing executable file ```the_dream_machine.exe``` into the same game folder where it resides, but change its name by adding an underscore to the beginning: ```_the_dream_machine.exe```.

So you should have two identical files with different names in the same folder: ```_the_dream_machine.exe``` and ```the_dream_machine.exe```.

> **Important:** if you simply rename the file (without copying it first), then when you try to launch the game, Steam will detect a discrepancy and redownload the game files. This may result in the translation (if any) being lost or not working correctly, and you will have to reinstall it (see below).

## How to install localization?
### Prerequisites
Install the old version of the game via Steam (see above)

### Install
> **Important:** it is highly NOT recommended to install this translation on the latest version of the game (due to memory leaks and frequent crashes, probably caused by some incompatibility between the old and new code).
1. Clone the repository or download it as a zip archive
2. Copy files into your game directory (for example, ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Dream Machine```)

## Recommendations
- During the game, press the ```Space``` key more often. It is responsible for highlighting the objects you can interact with (so you don't have to click on everything).
